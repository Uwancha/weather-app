# Weather App

This is a weather application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and webpack to bundle the files. The app fetches weather data from the [WeatherAPI ↗](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to provide real-time weather information for different locations.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the concepts of asynchronous code, working with APIs, and using async/await in JavaScript. It serves as a practical exercise while learning full-stack web development as part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

## Demo

You can try out the app by visiting the following live demo link: [Live Demo](https://uwancha.github.io/weather-app/)

## Features

- Real-time weather data: The app fetches real-time weather information from the WeatherAPI to provide accurate and up-to-date weather details.
- Location-based weather: Users can search for weather information for different locations by entering the city name.
- Asynchronous code: The app utilizes asynchronous JavaScript code to handle API requests and responses without blocking the main thread.
- Responsive design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before running the weather app, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org ↗](https://nodejs.org)
- npm: npm is the package manager for Node.js. It is usually installed automatically with Node.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the weather app:

1. Clone the repository: git clone.

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd weather-app`

3. Install dependencies: Run `npm install` to install the required packages and dependencies.

4. API Key: Sign up on [WeatherAPI ↗](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to obtain an API key.

5. Build the project: Run `npm run build` to build the project using webpack. This will bundle the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into a `dist` directory.

6. Open the app: Open the `index.html` file located in the `dist` directory in your web browser.

## Usage

- Enter a location: In the app's interface, enter the name of a city to fetch the weather data for that location.
- View weather details: Once the weather data is retrieved, the app will display the current temperature, weather condition, wind speed, humidity, and other relevant information.
- Search for different locations: You can search for weather information for different locations by entering new city names.
